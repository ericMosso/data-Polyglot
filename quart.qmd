## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

library(RPostgreSQL)
library(DBI)

# Reading in a Kaggle csv made for Heart Disease Prediction.

# Creates a dataframe to be used later when we create a SQL database table from it.

heartDF <- read.csv2 ( "Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv", 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       sep = "," )

# Establishing a connection with a local PostgreSQL database.

con <- dbConnect ( odbc::odbc(), 
                   "PostgreSQL35W", 
                   timeout = 10 )


# Using dbWriteTable() to create a table from the dataframe


dbWriteTable ( con, 
               "HeartTable", 
               heartDF, 
               row.names = FALSE, 
               append = TRUE )







```

```{python}





```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
